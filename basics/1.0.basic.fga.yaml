# Bob is the owner of the document "welcome" inside the folder "root", owned by Anne.
# Anne can view and edit the document because she is the owner of the folder.
# But Bob cannot view or edit the folder "root" because he is not the owner or editor of it.
# However, Bob can view and edit the document "welcome" because he is the owner of it.
