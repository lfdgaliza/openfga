tuples:
  ### Tuples for basic example
  # Anne is the owner of the root folder
  - user: user:anne
    object: folder:root
    relation: owner
  
  - user: folder:root
    object: document:welcome
    relation: parent

  # Bob is the owner of the document:welcome
  - user: user:bob
    object: document:welcome
    relation: owner

  ### Tuples for multi-tenancy example
  # Peter is an admin of the org:acme
  # and Peter can edit the root folder of the org:acme
  - user: user:peter
    object: org:acme
    relation: admin

  - user: org:acme
    object: folder:root
    relation: tenant

  ### Tuples for groups example
  # Martin is a member of the engineering group
  # and the engineering group is a member of the everyone group
  # and all members of the everyone group can edit the root folder
  - user: user:martin
    object: group:engineering
    relation: member

  - user: group:engineering#member
    object: group:everyone
    relation: member

  - user: group:everyone#member
    object: folder:root
    relation: editor
