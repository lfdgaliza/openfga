# Important: Super admin is a business concept, not a technical one.
# This is something defined by the configuration, not by OpenFGA.
# This example shows a way, like a design pattern, to define a super admin in OpenFGA.

tuples:
  ### Tuples for basic example
  # Anne is the owner of the root folder
  - user: user:anne
    object: folder:root
    relation: owner
  
  - user: folder:root
    object: document:welcome
    relation: parent

  # Bob is the owner of the document:welcome
  - user: user:bob
    object: document:welcome
    relation: owner

  ### Tuples for multi-tenancy example
  # Peter is an admin of the org:acme
  # and Peter can edit the root folder of the org:acme
  - user: user:peter
    object: org:acme
    relation: admin

  - user: org:acme
    object: folder:root
    relation: org

  ### Tuples for groups example
  # Martin is a member of the engineering group
  # and the engineering group is a member of the everyone group
  # and all members of the everyone group can edit the root folder
  - user: user:martin
    object: group:engineering
    relation: member

  - user: group:engineering#member
    object: group:everyone
    relation: member

  - user: group:everyone#member
    object: folder:root
    relation: editor

  ### Tuple for public access example
  - user: user:*
    object: document:public-roadmap
    relation: viewer

  ### Tuples for Relationship-based ABAC
  - user: folder:root
    object: document:document-not-published
    relation: parent

  - user: user:*
    object: document:document-not-published
    relation: viewer

  - user: document:public-roadmap
    object: document:public-roadmap
    relation: published

  ### Tuples for super-admin example and conditional relationships
  - user: user:sam
    object: system:root
    relation: super_admin
    condition: # This is now a necessary configuration to define the super admin
      name: time_based_grant
      context:
        grant_time: "2023-01-01T00:00:00Z"
        grant_duration: 1h

  - user: system:root
    object: org:acme
    relation: system

  ### Tuples for custom roles
  # Define custom roles for the organization
  - user: role:acme-organization-manager#assignee
    object: org:acme
    relation: can_add_admin

  - user: role:acme-content-editor#assignee
    object: org:acme
    relation: can_create_document

  # Assign users to custom roles
  - user: user:omar
    object: role:acme-organization-manager
    relation: assignee

  - user: user:edith
    object: role:acme-content-editor
    relation: assignee

  ### Tuples for fine grained API access
  - user: application:app-1
    object: org:acme
    relation: can_create_document

  - user: application:app-1
    object: org:acme
    relation: can_edit_folders
