I'm using this repo to learn OpenFGA.

* So far there is the "basics" folder where one can see mostly the code form [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUR5l-oTFZqWaDdhEOVt_IfPOIbKo1Ypt) playlist with some additions from me.
* Every file x.0 is a code from that playlist with tiny changes like comments or variable changes.
* Every file x.n where n > 0 is a use case made by me for some reason.

To use the files under `basics/`, run `fga model test --tests FILE.fga.yaml`
